# toy-wasm-runtime
自作 Wasm ランタイム

This is a toy WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime. It does not fully comply with the [Wasm specification (REC-wasm-core-1-20191205)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/REC-wasm-core-1-20191205/), but I hope it can still be helpful for understanding how Wasm works. I heavily referenced the excellent Wasm runtime implementation, [wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero).
